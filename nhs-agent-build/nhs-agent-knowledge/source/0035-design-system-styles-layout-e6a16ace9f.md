# Styles – Layout

Structure your page content and elements.

## Screen size

Design for mobile first using a single-column layout and work up to wider layouts. Most visitors to the NHS website are on a mobile device, so it's our first consideration.

The default maximum page width is 960px, but you can make it wider if your content requires it. But lines of text content should be no longer than 70 to 80 characters so that it's easy to read.

### Responsive breakpoints

- mobile: 320px

- tablet: 641px

- desktop: 769px

- large desktop: 990px

## Containers

To set up your layout, you will need to create 2 wrappers. The first wrapper is a container which sets the maximum width of the content but does not add any vertical margin or padding.

You can choose from a fixed-width container (960px) or a fluid-width container (which spans the entire width of the viewport).

### Container

Use nhsuk-width-container for a container with a maximum width of 960px.

```text
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-width-container"
>
<!-- Main content wrapper here -->
</
div
>
```

### Fluid container

Use nhsuk-width-container-fluid for a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.

```text
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-width-container-fluid"
>
<!-- Main content wrapper here -->
</
div
>
```

## Main content

The second wrapper is a main element with the nhsuk-main-wrapper class, which gives responsive padding to the top and bottom of the page and will be the wrapper for the main content of the page.

There should be only one main element and it should have a unique id of maincontent , which allows keyboard-only users to skip to the main content on a page with the skip link component .

```text
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-width-container"
>
<
main
class
=
"nhsuk-main-wrapper"
id
=
"maincontent"
>
<!-- Grid row wrapper here -->
</
main
>
</
div
>
```

The vertical padding can be made larger or smaller by using the nhsuk-main-wrapper--l or nhsuk-main-wrapper--s modifier classes. We recommend using smaller vertical padding on transactional services.

## Grid system

The grid is structured with a nhsuk-grid-row wrapper which acts as a row to contain your grid columns.

You can add columns inside this wrapper to create your layout. To define your columns, add the class beginning with nhsuk-grid-column- to a new container followed by the width, for example nhsuk-grid-column-one-third , to make it the width you want.

### Full width

```text
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-row"
>
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-column-full"
>
<
p
>
nhsuk-grid-column-full
</
p
>
</
div
>
</
div
>
```

### One-half

```text
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-row"
>
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-column-one-half"
>
<
p
>
nhsuk-grid-column-one-half
</
p
>
</
div
>
</
div
>
```

### Two-thirds

```text
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-row"
>
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-column-two-thirds"
>
<
p
>
nhsuk-grid-column-two-thirds
</
p
>
</
div
>
</
div
>
```

### One-third

```text
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-row"
>
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-column-one-third"
>
<
p
>
nhsuk-grid-column-one-third
</
p
>
</
div
>
</
div
>
```

### Three-quarters

```text
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-row"
>
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-column-three-quarters"
>
<
p
>
nhsuk-grid-column-three-quarters
</
p
>
</
div
>
</
div
>
```

### One-quarter

```text
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-row"
>
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-column-one-quarter"
>
<
p
>
nhsuk-grid-column-one-quarter
</
p
>
</
div
>
</
div
>
```

### Nested grids

```text

div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-row"
>

class
=
"nhsuk-grid-column-two-thirds"
>
<
p

<
div
class

<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-column-one-half"

p
>
nhsuk-grid-column-one-half
</
p
>
</
div
>
</
div
>
</
div

```

## Width override classes

If you need to constrain the width of an element independently of the grid system, you can use width override classes.

The width override classes start with nhsuk-u- . The second part of the class name indicates the width on larger screen sizes. For example: nhsuk-u-width-one-half will apply a width of one-half nhsuk-u-width-two-thirds will apply a width of two-thirds Open this example in a new tab : layout width Copy code < h3 class = "nhsuk-heading-m" > Full </ h3 > < div class = "nhsuk-form-group" > < label class = "nhsuk-label" for = "full-name-full" > Full name </ label > < input class = "nhsuk-input nhsuk-u-width-full" id = "full-name-full" name = "full-name" type = "text" > </ div > < h3 class = "nhsuk-heading-m" > Three-quarters </ h3 > < div class = "nhsuk-form-group" > < label class = "nhsuk-label" for = "full-name-three-quarters" > Full name </ label > < input class = "nhsuk-input nhsuk-u-width-three-quarters" id = "full-name-three-quarters" name = "full-name" type = "text" > </ div > < h3 class = "nhsuk-heading-m" > Two-thirds </ h3 > < div class = "nhsuk-form-group" > < label class = "nhsuk-label" for = "full-name-two-thirds" > Full name </ label > < input class = "nhsuk-input nhsuk-u-width-two-thirds" id = "full-name-two-thirds" name = "full-name" type = "text" > </ div > < h3 class = "nhsuk-heading-m" > One-half </ h3 > < div class = "nhsuk-form-group" > < label class = "nhsuk-label" for = "full-name-one-half" > Full name </ label > < input class = "nhsuk-input nhsuk-u-width-one-half" id = "full-name-one-half" name = "full-name" type = "text" > </ div > < h3 class = "nhsuk-heading-m" > One-third </ h3 > < div class = "nhsuk-form-group" > < label class = "nhsuk-label" for = "full-name-one-third" > Full name </ label > < input class = "nhsuk-input nhsuk-u-width-one-third" id = "full-name-one-third" name = "full-name" type = "text" > </ div > < h3 class = "nhsuk-heading-m" > One-quarter </ h3 > < div class = "nhsuk-form-group" > < label class = "nhsuk-label" for = "full-name-one-quarter" > Full name </ label > < input class = "nhsuk-input nhsuk-u-width-one-quarter" id = "full-name-one-quarter" name = "full-name" type = "text" > </ div > Common layouts Two-thirds in a fixed-width container Open this example in a new tab : layout two thirds container Copy code < div class = "nhsuk-width-container" > < main class = "nhsuk-main-wrapper" id = "maincontent" > < div class = "nhsuk-grid-row" > < div class = "nhsuk-grid-column-two-thirds" > < h2 > Two-thirds column </ h2 > </ div > </ div > </ main > </ div > One-third and two-thirds in a fluid-width container Open this example in a new tab : layout one third container fluid Copy code < div class = "nhsuk-width-container-fluid" > < main class = "nhsuk-main-wrapper" id = "maincontent" > < div class = "nhsuk-grid-row" > < div class = "nhsuk-grid-column-one-third" > < h2 > One-third column </ h2 > </ div > < div class = "nhsuk-grid-column-two-thirds" > < h2 > Two-thirds column </ h2 > </ div > </ div > </ main > </ div > Layout override classes Reading width To make it easy to read, lines of text should be no longer than 70 to 80 characters. When using the fluid-width container or wider grid columns, wrap text content with nhsuk-u-reading-width to apply a maximum width and limit the number of characters per line. Open this example in a new tab : layout reading width Copy code < div class = "nhsuk-grid-row" > < div class = "nhsuk-grid-column-full" > < div class = "nhsuk-u-reading-width" > < p > This is example content which would exceed 70-80 characters per line, if used within a full width column. The .nhsuk-u-reading-width override class will apply a maximum width and limit the number of characters per line. </ p > </ div > </ div > </ div > Tablet and mobile specific grid classes By default, grid column widths are applied on desktop (769px) and above. These override classes will enforce column widths on all screen sizes. To set your column width, add the nhsuk-u- override class followed by the width to an existing grid column. For example, nhsuk-u-one-half will set your column width to be one-half on all screen sizes. Open this example in a new tab : layout tablet mobile Copy code < div class = "nhsuk-grid-row" > < div class = "nhsuk-grid-column-one-half nhsuk-u-one-half" > < p > nhsuk-grid-column-one-half nhsuk-u-one-half </ p > </ div > </ div > Tablet specific grid classes These override classes will enforce column widths on tablet (641px) and above. To set your column width, add the nhsuk-u- override class followed by the width and the suffix -tablet to an existing grid column. For example, nhsuk-u-one-third-tablet will set your column width to be one-third on screen sizes tablet and above. Open this example in a new tab : layout tablet Copy code < div class = "nhsuk-grid-row" > < div class = "nhsuk-grid-column-one-third nhsuk-u-one-third-tablet" > < p > nhsuk-grid-column-one-third nhsuk-u-one-third-tablet </ p > </ div > </ div > Help us improve this guidance Share insights or feedback and take part in the discussion.

## Common layouts

### Two-thirds in a fixed-width container

```text
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-width-container"
>
<
main
class
=
"nhsuk-main-wrapper"
id
=
"maincontent"
>
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-row"
>
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-column-two-thirds"
>
<
h2
>
Two-thirds column
</
h2
>
</
div
>
</
div
>
</
main
>
</
div
>
```

### One-third and two-thirds in a fluid-width container

```text
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-width-container-fluid"
>
<
main
class
=
"nhsuk-main-wrapper"
id
=
"maincontent"
>
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-row"
>
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-column-one-third"
>
<
h2
>
One-third column
</
h2
>
</
div
>
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-column-two-thirds"
>
<
h2
>
Two-thirds column
</
h2
>
</
div
>
</
div
>
</
main
>
</
div
>
```

## Layout override classes

### Reading width

To make it easy to read, lines of text should be no longer than 70 to 80 characters.

When using the fluid-width container or wider grid columns, wrap text content with nhsuk-u-reading-width to apply a maximum width and limit the number of characters per line.

```text
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-row"
>
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-column-full"
>
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-u-reading-width"
>
<
p
>
This is example content which would exceed 70-80 characters per line, if used within a full width column. The .nhsuk-u-reading-width override class will apply a maximum width and limit the number of characters per line.
</
p
>
</
div
>
</
div
>
</
div
>
```

### Tablet and mobile specific grid classes

By default, grid column widths are applied on desktop (769px) and above. These override classes will enforce column widths on all screen sizes.

To set your column width, add the nhsuk-u- override class followed by the width to an existing grid column. For example, nhsuk-u-one-half will set your column width to be one-half on all screen sizes.

```text
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-row"
>
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-column-one-half nhsuk-u-one-half"
>
<
p
>
nhsuk-grid-column-one-half nhsuk-u-one-half
</
p
>
</
div
>
</
div
>
```

### Tablet specific grid classes

These override classes will enforce column widths on tablet (641px) and above.

To set your column width, add the nhsuk-u- override class followed by the width and the suffix -tablet to an existing grid column. For example, nhsuk-u-one-third-tablet will set your column width to be one-third on screen sizes tablet and above.

```text
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-row"
>
<
div
class
=
"nhsuk-grid-column-one-third nhsuk-u-one-third-tablet"
>
<
p
>
nhsuk-grid-column-one-third nhsuk-u-one-third-tablet
</
p
>
</
div
>
</
div
>
```
